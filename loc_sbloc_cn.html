<br>
<br>
In "Steel Battalion Line of Contact" there is a feature which automatically measures all participants' connections speeds while participants are in the waiting area (lobby).  After a fixed period of time, this feature automatically disconnects a client from the host if their internet connection quality does not satisfy connection speed requirements. As slow connection speeds tend to interrupt game play, this feature has been implemented in order to ensure a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience for all users.
<br>
<br>
The Xbox Dashboard provides a method to obtain an estimate of connection speed.  However, this method (often referred to as the "Y button codes") should NOT necessarily be viewed as the <span class="italic">actual</span> speed of a given user's connection.  The reason for this is as follows.  If a device (e.g. a router or DOCSIS cable modem configuration) or environmental factor (network congestion) on a user’s network is manipulating network traffic, then the computed bandwidth measurements in the Xbox Dashboard may be incorrect.  Further, they may vary dramatically from one user to the next.  
<br>
<br>
Users should be aware of the upload and download speeds they have purchased from their service provider.  Users may also utilize free web-based utilities to estimate upload and download speeds.  If there is a large difference between those speeds found in the Xbox Dashboard and external sources, then it is likely that networking equipment (as described above) is artificially influencing the computations of bandwidth within the Xbox Dashboard.  
The number of players that a console can host is determined by bandwidth measurements taken while players are in the lobby. The requisite bandwidth changes according to the number of participants in a session.  Therefore, the following depends upon the maximum number of people that has been set for a session.  In cases where the line quality is not fulfilled the user will be automatically disconnected from the host.
Samples of upload speeds versus players that can be hosted are provided below:

<table width="500" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" bordercolor="#FFFFFF">
  <tr>
    <td>64,000 bps.....2 people</td>
    <td>64,000bps.....3 people</td>
    <td>68,400 bps.....4 people</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>91,200 bps......5 people</td>
    <td>114,000 bps......6 people</td>
    <td>136,800 bps.....7 people</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>159,600 bps.....8 people</td>
    <td>182,400 bps.....9 people</td>
    <td>205,200 bps.....10 people</td>
  </tr>

<br>
<br>
Due to delays in Network Data communications, the way in which the game controls reflect upon actual game play may not correspond properly (this condition is known as "latency").  High the latency (represented in "ms" or "milliseconds") increases the potential for laggy games. As this also tends to interrupt game play, an icon displaying connection speed will be displayed in the waiting lobby of <span class="italic">Steel Battalion: Line of Contact</span>.  This display will enable users to make a game play decision.
<br>
<br>
The latency icon display in the lobby of Steel Battalion Line of Contact is as follows.
<br>
<br>
Latency Number:&nbsp;&loz;
<br>
<table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td>3 Antennas ~ less than 100 ms</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2 Antennas ~ less than 200 ms</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1 Antenna ~ less than 300 ms</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>X mark ~ above 300 ms</td>
  </tr>
