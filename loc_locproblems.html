Dear Capcom customer,
<br>
<br>
It has come to Capcom’s attention that some of you are having connection problems with our Xbox Live video game, <span class="italic">Steel Battalion: Line of Contact</span>.  Capcom is investigating the possible causes of this problem(s), and is trying to identify the best solution(s). We have discovered that potential problems may either be the Internet connection not meeting the minimum requirements of the game (for a description please refer to <a href="../www.capcom.com/support/sbloc_cn.html" target="_blank">http://www.capcom.com/support/sbloc_cn.doc</a>); the specific router being used; the Xbox connection testing software; Capcom’s game code; your ISP configuration; or the firewall.   Additionally, we have found that Customers in Canada appear to be experiencing more problems than those in the US.
<br>
<br>
Fewer connection problems seem to occur when six or less players are simultaneously playing on a mission or if they have upgraded their connections or hardware. Also, connection problems seem to increase as the number of players increases. 
<br>
<br>
If you are experiencing problems, you can help us discover the cause by filling out the following form (<a href="http://www.capcom.com/support/LoC-questions" target="_blank">http://www.capcom.com/support/LoC-questions</a>) and returning it to our customer service department: <a href="mailto:megamail@capcom.com">megamail@capcom.com</a>. 
<br>
<br>
As soon as we have a solution we will post it on our BBS and website.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your patience,
<br>
<br>
Hiroshi Tobisawa
<br>
President, Capcom USA
<br>
